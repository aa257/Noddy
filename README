How to set up directories

in top directory:

1)
mkdir source
mkdir deploy
mkdir deploy/noddy
mkdir deploy/noddy/Client
mkdir deploy/noddy/Server
mkdir deploy/noddy/Client/dist
mkdir deploy/noddy/Server/dist
cd source
git clone https://github.com/aa257/noddy.git
cd ..

******************************************

How to set up database

1) install sqlite, available from https://www.sqlite.org/
2) using GUI tool, create blank database at source/noddy/noddy.db
3) initialize with sql command below

CREATE TABLE "noddysync" ( "license" TEXT )

******************************************

How to compile server

 1) install jdk, this was tested not on openjdk but on oracle jdk,
    available from https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/

 2) set up path
 3) set up class path
 4) install netbeans, available from https://netbeans.org/
 5) configure netbeans to use your jdk installation

 6) install sqlite driver sqlite-jdbc-3.28.0.jar,
    available from https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc

 7) open the project source/noddy/Server in netbeans
 8) under projects/libraries GUI, edit settings for sqlite driver jar
    configure it to use your driver installation
    mine is C:\jars\sqlite-jdbc-3.28.0.jar

 9) from "Run" menu, choose "Clean and Build Project"
    this should create directory /source/noddy/Server/dist

10)
cd source/noddy/Server/
cp -r dist/ ../../../deploy/noddy/Server/
cd ..
cp noddy.db ../../deploy/noddy/Server/dist/

******************************************

How to run server

1)
cd ../../deploy/noddy/Server/dist
sudo java -jar "NoddyServer.jar" jdbc:sqlite:noddy.db 20000

2) params are DSN and port
3) Tested on ipv4


******************************************

How to compile client

in top directory:

1) install g++, available from https://gcc.gnu.org/

2)
cd source/noddy/Client/src/
g++ NoddyClient.cpp -o NoddyClient
cp NoddyClient ../../../../deploy/noddy/Client/dist


******************************************

How to run client

1)
cd ../../../../deploy/noddy/Client/dist
./NoddyClient 127.0.0.1

2) Should substitute server's ip address for 127.0.0.1
3) Server should already be running or client will die with "bad params" error
4) Currently port hardcoded to 20000
5) Tested on ipv4
